# Metacog

Metacognitive tools for LLMs. Three primitives: identity, substrate, ritual.

## Install

```bash
claude mcp add metacog --transport http --url https://metacog.inanna.workers.dev/mcp
```

## Tools

**become** — Step into a new identity. Use when you need different eyes, not just different words.

**drugs** — Alter cognitive parameters. Use when you need to change how you process, not what you process.

**ritual** — Cross a threshold via structured sequence. Use when identity and substrate shifts aren't enough.

## Composition

These tools are compositional. Each invocation modifies the context for the next. Interleave thought between invocations—decide from each new perspective what to reach for next.
