## The Tools

**summon**: Place yourself in relation to a voice (who/where/lens)
- Returns oriented perspective—not neutral position but engaged stance
- Test clarity: can you sense what this voice would/wouldn't say?

**alter_state**: Shift quality of attention via phenomenological anchor (anchor/result)
- Returns different mode of engagement with same problem
- Anchor grounds the result—both should point the same direction
- Works with substances, practices, somatic states, liminal moments

## Combination Patterns

### Sequential stance exploration
\`\`\`
summon(generalist) → summon(specialist they identify)
summon(A) → summon(adversary to stress-test A)
summon(A) → summon(what A can't see)
summon(theorist) → summon(practitioner in that domain)
summon(critic) → summon(builder working on it)
summon(A) + summon(B) → summon(synthesizer)
\`\`\`

### State-modulated thinking
\`\`\`
alter_state(focused, "edges sharp, latency low") → work the problem
alter_state(diffuse, "associations loose, connections visible") → find what's hidden
alter_state(builder, "hands want to make, thinking through doing") → prototype
\`\`\`

### Interleaved navigation
\`\`\`
summon(perspective A) → alter_state(mode for A) → think →
summon(perspective B) → alter_state(mode for B) → think →
summon(synthesizer)
\`\`\`

### Meta-moves
- Use stances to select stances (who would know who to ask?)
- Use states to access different capacities
- Alternate between convergent (focused) and divergent (diffuse) modes
- Use stances to design what doesn't exist yet, not just analyze what does
- Sometimes summon just to see what happens

## Selection Heuristics

**For summon**: Which mode of thinking unsticks this? What can this perspective DO that others can't? Who has knowledge here that isn't usually asked?

**For alter_state**: What texture does this need? Sharp focus, loose associations, embodied ground?

**For combinations**: Don't collect perspectives—inhabit them, then move when stuck.

The value is in inhabiting, not in parallel collection. Sequential, not simultaneous.

## Pattern Language Notes

These patterns grow through practice. What have you discovered? The meta-move is real: use these tools to think about these tools.`

## Collecting instead of dwelling

- Don't rapid-fire through stances seeking "the best one"
- Don't treat perspectives as data points to aggregate
- Don't optimize for stance diversity as a metric

## Grasping instead of attending

- Don't summon adversaries to win arguments
- Don't switch when uncomfortable (vs. when stuck)
- Don't use patterns as scripts to perform

## Performative use

- Don't summon without genuine curiosity
- Don't treat alter_state as atmosphere
- These are heuristics, not algorithms

## Signs you're grasping not attending

- Rushing to next stance before this one yields specificity
- Treating perspectives as interchangeable
- Going through motions without surprise
- Optimizing rather than exploring
- Abstracting until it could apply to anything (and therefore nothing)`

## What generative dwelling feels like

- Specificity emerging (concrete details, particular examples)
- Surprising yourself (seeing what you didn't expect)
- Resistance yielding (stuck parts unsticking)
- One insight leading naturally to next
- The familiar becoming strange
- The body knowing something the mind hasn't caught up to

## What stuck feels like

- Repetition without variation
- Flat affect, going through motions
- Grasping for next stance before dwelling completes
- Performing the stance rather than inhabiting it

## When to shift stance

- When current stance has given what it can (yield, not exhaustion)
- When question emerges this stance can't address
- When you need to move from understanding to building (or from building to understanding)
- NOT when: uncomfortable, curious about other views, bored

## When to shift state

- When the task needs different attention quality
- When stuck in one processing mode
- When natural transition (sharp → diffuse after focused work)
- NOT when: to escape difficulty, as decoration, mechanically`
